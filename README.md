Unable to enable code review for merge until I can get everything cleaned up and make this repo public.
As always you can push code up as often as you want, that does not affect main.
Try to send a message to someone to have them look over your code for your benefit and theirs as well.
It is good practice and will allow you to see methods you don't always use yourself.
It is by no means a requirement, just something we should stay in the habit of.

Feel free to add whatever components you may want to, as of now there is no clear direction for this project.
